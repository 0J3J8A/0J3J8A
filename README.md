JUAN JOSE AGUIRRE
Hello, GitHub! 👋

I'm Juan Jose Aguirre, a Software Development student at Brigham Young University-Idaho. I'm passionate about building software solutions, whether it’s creating websites, developing applications, or exploring data analysis. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🙂About Me

I'm currently learning SQL, data analysis, and exploring more advanced concepts in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C#, and SQL.
My goal is to become a full-stack developer, apply my creative problem-solving skills to real-world projects, and ultimately secure a role where I can grow and contribute to a team.

Fun fact: My GitHub username, "0J3J8A," is a bit of a mystery. Here's the story:
   - "JJA" comes from my name.
   - The "38" is because I was born on the 19th, and my mom was also born on the 19th, so 19 + 19 = 38.
   - The "0" at the beginning? Well, numbers with leading zeros just look nicer, don't they? 😄

In addition to my technical interests, I am passionate about gaming, drawing, and taekwondo, which help me maintain a balanced, creative mindset. I love transforming ideas into real, tangible things, whether it's through coding or art.

✅Past Experience

🎖️Customer Service Expert – Remote
Teleperformance | March 2025 – Present
I provide remote customer support to clients across the U.S. and Canada, handling an average of 40–50 calls daily. This experience has developed my multitasking skills, problem-solving, and empathy, which I find invaluable when working on software projects. The ability to listen carefully to customers has helped me improve my communication and conflict resolution abilities—skills I apply to any development challenge.
Accomplishments:
 - Managed high-volume calls and emails while maintaining customer satisfaction.
 - Demonstrated strong time management and multitasking abilities in a fast-paced environment.

🎖️Volunteer Missionary – Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
2019-2021
During two years of volunteer service, I interacted with people from all walks of life, honing my communication and interpersonal skills. This experience taught me the importance of active listening, understanding individual needs, and working with diverse perspectives. These lessons directly influence my approach to software development and teamwork.
